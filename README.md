# To-Do App
### Purpose of the Application

It is a basic To-Do application. A good practical example of CRUD processes. A beginner friendly project to solidify your knowledge of fundamentals. The main purpose of this application is to create a task, delete a task and view the list of the tasks. I have added two scripts, one with procedural pattern and other with Object-Oriented Design.

### Language Requirements
Python 3.x

### Few Featues of the Application

- Store the list in the memory so that it can be viewed after quitting the program. 
    * SQLite database is used for the above goal.
        * A cursor in SQLite is an object that allows you to execute SQL queries and fetch results. Basically a middleware between SQLite database connection and SQL query. It is created after giving connection to SQLite database.

- View the date and time when an item was added and removed. 
    
- Add the priority order of a task in the list. For example, 1 defines most important and 5 defines least important.
    * Added the functionality to add the priority order of the task.

- Mark a task as completed.
